              <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>
              
              <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
              <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>
              
              <h3>General Information on the Legal Basis of Data Processing on this Website</h3>
              <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally carried out on the basis of § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for contract fulfillment or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.

Data processing may also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
              
              <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
              <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
              
              <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
              <p><strong>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</strong></p>
              <p><strong>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</strong></p>
              
              <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
              <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
              
              <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
              <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent that it is technically feasible.</p>
              
              <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
              <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of data processing at any time, and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time regarding this and other questions about personal data.</p>
              
              <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
              <p>You have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
                <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
                <li>If you have lodged an objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from its storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or a member state.</p>

              <p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of its website – for this purpose, server log files must be recorded.</p>
              
              <h3>Inquiry by Email</h3>
              <p>If you contact us by email, your inquiry including all resulting personal data (name, email address, inquiry content) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
              <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested; consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
              <p>The data you send to us via email will remain with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions – in particular legal retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>

              <p>Google Analytics enables the website operator to analyze the behavior of website visitors. The website operator receives various usage data, such as page views, visit duration, operating systems used, and user origin. This data may be summarized by Google in a profile that is assigned to the respective user or their end device.</p>
              <p>Google Analytics uses technologies that enable user recognition for the purpose of analyzing user behavior (e.g., cookies or device fingerprinting). The information collected by Google about the use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
              <p>The use of this analysis tool is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both its web offering and its advertising. If corresponding consent has been requested, processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user's end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG.
